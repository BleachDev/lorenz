Lorenz 0.5.0
===========

Lorenz 0.5.0 has enjoyed a long development process (beginning the 1st of September!),
and packs a bundle of cool changes. The most notable being the change of package, from
`me.jamiemansfield.lorenz` to `org.cadixdev.lorenz`.

## Modularisation

The long put-off modularisation I've spoken off, has finally arrived - with the Enigma,
JAM, and Kin formats being thrown into their own individual modules.
