Lorenz 0.6.0
============

## JSON Format / GSON Module

Lorenz now has a JSON format, built on Google's GSON library. The format is registered in
Lorenz's system as `"json"`, and will allow external tooling (such as Survey) to embed
mappings into their own configurations with ease.

To use the GSON Module / JSON Format, simply add `org.cadixdev:lorenz-io-gson:0.6.0` to
your build tool.
