Lorenz 0.5.3
============

Lorenz 0.5.3 includes yet-another set of bug-fixes:

- [Mercury/GH-14]: Inheritance completion now considers elevated return types
- [Bombe/GH-11]: Bump Bombe dependency to 0.3.2, including a fix for remapping
  manifests without a `Main-Class` attribute.
- [Lorenz/GH-30]: Don't wrap `Writer`s in `TextMappingsWriter`, allowing files
  larger than `BufferedWriter`s buffer to be written (thanks to @phase for this
  bug-fix).
