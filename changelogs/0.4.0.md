Lorenz 0.4.0
============

This version of Lorenz consolidates the work towards supporting additional formats, even
going as far to support those formats. A number of breaking changes have been made in order
to support these formats, in addition to new constructs to make using Lorenz easier.

## Changes

- Void is no longer considered a primitive type, as well it isn't, `VoidType#INSTANCE` should
  now be used.
- The LineProcessors for mapping readers are now contained as inner classes of the parent
  reader.
